1) compose file with (1) the current app, (2) pull dockerimage for the "containerized-image-processing"
2) create app that listens to a channel, downloads the imagedata as needed, passes that into the container for processing
3) get the result out, save it somewhere, log the process, send out a message to rabbit

A) when image built, add it to harbor-registry and activate by DOING "amplify-imageproc-PoC"

docker build -t harbor-registry.whoi.edu/amplify/imageproc-runner:latest .
